  "text": "Summary: The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of Zolpidem CR to that of placebo in improving sleep efficiency in people with dementia admitted to the hospital because of their symptoms. You can participate in this study if you have dementia of the Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. This study involves placebo; a placebo is a tablet that looks exactly like Zolpidem CR, the study drug, but contains no active study drug. We will use placebos to see if the study results are due to the study drug or due to other reasons. Zolpidem CR is also called Ambien CR and is widely available by prescription. Zolpidem CR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term treatment of insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep).\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Age between 60-99 years \n\n Clinical diagnosis of Dementia of the Alzheimer's type or Vascular Dementia \n\n Only subjects with Mini Mental Status Examination scores of greater or equal to 10 will be enrolled. \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Subjects who are too agitated to be able to wear the activity monitors; \n\n Subjects who are actively suicidal or homicidal or for whom the clinical treatment team considers participation in the study to be unsuitable; \n\n Subjects with untreated primary sleep disorders; \n\n Subjects who receive hypnotic medications during their participation in the study; Subjects who received hypnotic medications prior to enrollment may participate in the study if they agree to stop receiving hypnotic medications (with their attending physician's approval); \n\n Subjects who are receiving over the counter sleep aids; \n\n Subjects who can not commit to abstaining from alcohol use while in the study; \n\n Subjects with known anaphylactic reaction or angioedema with Zolpidem CR.",
