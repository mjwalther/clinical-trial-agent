  "text": "Summary: Analyze in children and adults, risk factors in the onset of the APA. The main hypothesis focuses on the use of anti-inflammatory in the context of pharyngitis or sore throat before the symptoms of ABS. Secondary objectives:~- Analyze the implementation of a rapid diagnostic test and its result on the occurrence of an ABS~- Measure the frequency of prescription and describe the reasons for not prescribing an antibiotic for patients who consulted for a sore throat and having developed a PLA~- Describe the microbial flora could puncture of patients hospitalized for APA\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n clinical existence of a PLA (phlegmon), validated by a senior ENT, usually (but not necessarily) following a request by an emergency. The visible appearance to the merits throat must justify puncture. Cases will be included whether or not they had consulted for a sore throat in the 10 days preceding the date of diagnosis \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Neoplastic disease of the throat, scalable Hematologic with tonsillar localization History of tonsillectomy",
