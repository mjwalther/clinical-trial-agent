  "text": "Summary: Study to determine the safety of Atrovent Nasal Spray 0.06% in pediatric patients (ages 2-5 years) with symptoms of rhinorrhea associated with a naturally occurring common cold or from symptoms of rhinorrhea associated with allergies\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria for patients with common cold \n\n Male or female at least 2 but not older than 5 years of age at screening \n\n Have a diagnosis of a common cold defined as presence of acute onset of rhinorrhea (within 48 hours of screening visit) and at least 1 of the following: \n\n Presence of swollen nasal membranes characteristic of a common cold on examination at screening \n\n Presence of fever up to 102°F (oral or equivalent) within 48 hours of visit (may be taken at home/away from the clinic) or at time of screening \n\n Capability of parent/legal guardian to read and understand the informed consent, record trial diary information, administer trial drug and read and understand trial assessment questionnaire \n\n inclusion criteria for patients with allergies \n\n Male or female at least 2 but not older than 5 year of age \n\n Have a diagnosis of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis defined as having both of the following: \n\n Positive skin or Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) test to a relevant allergen within 12 months of screening or at the screening visit. For the purpose of this trial a positive skin test is defined as wheal diameter that is at least 3 mm greater than the negative control \n\n Positive prior history for atopy with nasal symptoms associated with expose to allergens \n\n Symptoms associated with rhinorrhea for at least 48 hours prior to the screening visit \n\n Capability of parent/legal guardian to read and understand the informed consent, record trial diary information, administer trial drug and read and understand trial assessment questionnaire \n\n General \nExclusion criteria:  for both common cold and allergy \n\n Significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, endocrine, metabolic, neurologic or other systemic disease.
