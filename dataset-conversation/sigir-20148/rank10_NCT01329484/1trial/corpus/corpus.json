In addition, the investigators hypothesize that using the computerized systems will result in improved well-being of the patients and their main caregivers / family members, and in improved patient-caregiver and patient-family relations.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease \n\n MMSE score of 14-26 \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Visual impairment \n\n Auditory impairment \n\n Psychiatric disorders",
