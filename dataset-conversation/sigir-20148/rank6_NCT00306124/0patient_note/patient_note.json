  "text": "A 62-year-old man sees a neurologist for progressive memory loss and jerking movements of the lower extremities. Neurologic examination confirms severe cognitive deficits and memory dysfunction. An electroencephalogram shows generalized periodic sharp waves. Neuroimaging studies show moderately advanced cerebral atrophy. A cortical biopsy shows diffuse vacuolar changes of the gray matter with reactive astrocytosis but no inflammatory infiltration."
