  "text": "Summary: The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of oral and inhaled administration of L-arginine and of inhaled aminoguanidine on bronchial and alveolar exhaled NO and NO metabolites in exhaled breath condensate, induced sputum, nasal lavage and mouth wash fluid in healthy non-smokers, current smokers and patients with COPD.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Healthy non-smokers \n\n Normal spirometry (FEV1 >90 % predicted; exhaled NO bigger than or equal to 10 ppb; flow 50 ml/s) \n\n At risk (current smokers) \n\n Normal spirometry, with or without chronic symptoms (cough, sputum production) \n\n FEV1 reversibility of <15% after inhaled beta2-agonists* \n\n Moderate COPD \n\n FEV1 greater than or equal to 30% and < 80% \n\n FEV1/FVC < 70% predicted \n\n FEV1 reversibility of <15% after inhaled beta2-agonists \n\n With or without chronic symptoms (cough, sputum production, dyspnea) \n\n Able to comprehend and grant a written informed consent \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Concomitant use or pre-treatment within the last 4 weeks with oral steroids \n\n Respiratory infection within 4 weeks prior to entry into the trial \n\n Females who are pregnant or lactating \n\n History of current or past drug or alcohol abuse",
