  "text": "Summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of QVA149 (110/50 μg o.d.) vs tiotropium (18 µg o.d.) + salmeterol/fluticasone propionate FDC (50/500 µg b.i.d.) in patients with moderate to severe COPD\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Patients who have signed Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of any study-related procedure. \n\n Male and female adults aged ≥ 40 years. \n\n Patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction with stable COPD (Stage 2 or Stage 3) according to the 2014 GOLD Guidelines. \n\n Patients with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥40 and < 80% of the predicted normal value, and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 at run-in Visit 101.

An ex-smoker is defined as a patient who has not smoked for ≥ 6 months at screening. \n\n Patients who are on triple treatment at least for the last 6 months (LAMA +LABA/ICS). \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Patients who have not achieved acceptable spirometry results at Visit 101 in accordance with ATS (American Thoracic Society)/ERS (European Respiratory Society) criteria for acceptability (one retest may be performed for patients that don't meet the acceptability criteria) . \n\n Patients who have had more than one COPD exacerbation that required treatment with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids and/or hospitalization in the last year prior to Visit 1. \n\n Patients who developed a COPD exacerbation of any severity either 6 weeks before the screening (Visit 1) or between screening (Visit 1) and treatment (Visit 201) will not be eligible but will be permitted to be re-screened after a minimum of 6 weeks after the resolution of the COPD exacerbation. \n\n Other protocol-defined inclusion/",
