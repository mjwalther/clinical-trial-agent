  "text": "Summary: The objective of this study is to investigate molecular, cytological and genetic features of occupational chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in conditions of different occupational exposures. In order to achieve this goal serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and standard inflammation markers level, hemostasis, cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage and associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1800470 transforming growing factor β1 (TGF β1) gene, rs1828591 hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) gene, rs4129267 interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) gene, rs1051730 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRNA3) gene with COPD in subjects exposed to silica dust and in those exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhaust will be investigated. The relationship between genotype and phenotype characteristics, such as an inflammation activity, assessed by C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α) serum concentration, in different occupational COPD groups will be studied. The hypothesis is that the mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are different due to environmental risk factor that reflex in differs in disease attributes - molecular biomarkers, cytology results and genetic susceptibility between COPD due to dust, COPD due to chemicals and COPD in smokers therefore COPD can be subdivided into ecological phenotypes according to environmental risk factor.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Post- bronchodilator forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio less than 0.7 \n\n Stable phase of COPD \n\n History of exposure to respirable silica dust, nonsmokers with absence of passive exposure to tobacco smoke or history of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhaust, nonsmokers with absence of passive exposure to tobacco smoke or current tobacco smokers without history of occupational exposure \n\n COPD risk factor exposure (occupational or tobacco smoke) duration not less than 12 months \n\n Male \n\n Caucasian \n\n Age of 40 - 75 years old \n\n Control group - healthy people \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n history of biomass smoke exposure \n\n age less than 40 and above 75 years old \n\n current COPD exacerbation \n\n concomitant asthma \n\n tuberculosis and other pulmonary diseases \n\n allergic and autoimmune disorders \n\n active infections \n\n immunodeficiency, including HIV infection \n\n parasitological diseases \n\n malignancies \n\n lack of informed consent",
