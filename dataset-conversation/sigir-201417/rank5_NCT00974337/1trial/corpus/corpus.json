  "text": "Summary: The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of relative adrenal insufficiency in preterm very low birth weight infants with and without shock.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n All preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) very low birth weight (birth weight 750-1500grams.) infants born at AIIMS would be eligible for enrollment in the study. Of these infants, those who meet the following criteria would be enrolled. \n\n Cases: Preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) infants with birth weight between 750 and 1500 grams with shock in the first week of life requiring vasopressor therapy (dopamine or dobutamine or both in a dose of > 10 mcg/kg/min) \n\n Controls: Stable preterm (28 to 34 week gestation) infants with birth weight between 750 and 1500 grams who are matched for gestational age, birth weight, postnatal-age. \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Major congenital malformations \n\n Mother receiving anticonvulsant / anti-tubercular drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid) \n\n Postnatal corticosteroid treatment \n\n Refusal to give consent",
