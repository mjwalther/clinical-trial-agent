  "text": "Summary: A trial to examine whether a new heart failure blood test can improve the outcome of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath.~We hypothesise that a BNP test performed in real-time in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath will help identify additional patients with CHF and consequently to change practice and allow more patients to recieve correct treatment earlier.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n We plan to include all patients presenting to the ED with shortness of breath that are over 40 years old and present with an emergency department triage category of 3 or higher. \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Patients presenting with a traumatic cause of dyspnea, patients with severe renal disease (serum creatinine level of more than 250 micro mmol/L, patients with cardiogenic shock, and patients who have an early transfer to another hospital (within 24 hrs) will be excluded.",
