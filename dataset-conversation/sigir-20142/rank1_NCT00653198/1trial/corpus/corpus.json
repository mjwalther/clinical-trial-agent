  "title": "Effectiveness of Rotarix™ Against Rotavirus Severe Gastroenteritis (RV SGE) in Infants in Panama",
  "text": "Summary: This study aims to estimate the effectiveness of Rotarix™ vaccine which is used nationwide as a part of the expanded program on immunization (EPI), in preventing RV SGE among hospitalised children born after 1 March 2006, which corresponds to the date of introduction of Rotarix™ in the national immunization program.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria for enrolled subjects and cases : \n\n A male or female child born after 1 March 2006 (which corresponds to the date of introduction of Rotarix™ in the EPI) and at least 12 weeks of age. \n\n Subject admitted to the study hospital for SGE (refer to the glossary) during the study period. \n\n Onset of SGE <= 14 days prior to admission. \n\n Laboratory confirmed (i.e. by ELISA at the hospital laboratory) RV positive stool sample at hospital admission or during the first 48 hours of hospitalisation. Note: This criterion is applicable only for cases. \n\n Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. \n\n inclusion criteria for controls: \n\n Admitted for non-GE causes at the same hospital as the case. Note: This criterion is applicable to hospital controls only. \n\n Living in the same neighbourhood as the case for at least three consecutive months. Note: This criterion is applicable to neighbourhood controls only. \n\n At least 12 weeks of age and being born within ± 2 weeks from the date of birth of the case. If the list of children born within ± 2 weeks is exhausted, then the range would be extended to ± 4 weeks. \n\n Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the child. \n\n \nExclusion criteria:  for enrolled subjects and cases: \n\n Subject has previously participated as case or control in this study. \n\n Hospitalisation is unrelated to GE. \n\n Onset of SGE > 48 hours after admission to the hospital (nosocomial infections). \n\n ",
