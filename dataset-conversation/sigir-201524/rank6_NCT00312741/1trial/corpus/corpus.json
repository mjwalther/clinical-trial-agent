Therefore, early detection of the etiology allows to select the most active, narrow-spectrum, and cheap, and less toxic antibiotic agent.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Age: 18 years and above \n\n Clinical and radiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia \n\n Informed consent of patient \n\n Hospital admission \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Prior hospital admission (less than 15 days) \n\n Alternative diagnosis at the discharge \n\n Immunosuppression (HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapies, neutropenia) \n\n Risk factors for unusual etiologies \n\n Patient is pregnant",
