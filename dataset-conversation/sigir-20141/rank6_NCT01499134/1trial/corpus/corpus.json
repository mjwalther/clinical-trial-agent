  "text": "Summary: This is a 26-week, prospective double-blind, randomized pilot trial of nebivolol versus an active control, metoprolol succinate, in patients with established lower-extremity peripheral artery disease, hypertension, and at least moderate risk for coronary artery disease.\nInclusion criteria: inclusion criteria: \n\n Men and non-pregnant, non-lactating women 45 years of age or older \n\n Able to give informed consent and complete scheduled visits \n\n Mild-moderate bilateral lower extremity peripheral arterial disease as defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI measurement of 0.6-0.9. If a subject has baseline claudication symptoms, the symptoms must be stable for the 3 months preceding enrollment. \n\n History of hypertension. Blood pressure at the screening visit must be ≤160/100 mmHg and ≥100/60 mmHg for all subjects. If a subject is currently prescribed beta-blocker therapy, BP at the screening visit must be ≤140/90 mmHg. In addition, heart rate must be ≥55 beats per minute if currently prescribed a beta-blocker and ≤60 beats per minute if not currently prescribed a beta-blocker. \n\n At least moderate risk for CAD. \n\n \nExclusion criteria: : \n\n Participation in another clinical trial \n\n Ongoing ischemic (resting) limb pain, or lower extremity ulceration due to arterial insufficiency, or an ABI indicating <0.6 indicating disease potentially requiring revascularization \n\n History of limb or digit amputation due to arterial insufficiency \n\n Revascularization of peripheral vessels within the preceding 6 months \n\n Uncontrolled hypertension as defined by systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg \n\n Contraindication or allergy to beta blocker therapy \n\n History of myocardial infarction , coronary revascularization, or a cerebrovascular event within the preceding 6 months \n\n Class III or IV angina \n\n Current or past history of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure \n\n Inability to walk on a treadmill for any reason \n\n Regular use of nitroglycerin or nitrates including oral, transdermal ointment or patch, or sublingual, translingual spray and/or combination agents containing nitrates \n\n Active liver, pulmonary, infectious or inflammatory process \n\n History of malignancy within preceding 5 years (excluding basal or squamous cell skin cancer) \n\n History of any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, renders it unsafe for the subject to be enrolled",
