    "title": "Computerized Personal Interventions for Alzheimer's Patients",
    "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of computerized systems in 2 common non pharmacological therapies (cognitive training and reminiscence therapy) will improve the cognitive function of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), or at least delay its deterioration. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that using the computerized systems will result in improved well-being of the patients and their main caregivers / family members, and in improved patient-caregiver and patient-family relations.",
