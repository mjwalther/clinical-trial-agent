    "title": "Search a Correlation Between Lp(a) Rate and TFPI Activity in Obese Patients With Chest Pain Like Angina",
    "brief_summary": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in our countries. Clinically, symptoms could be chest pain suggesting stable angina. Atherosclerosis is influenced by cardiovascular risk factors which obesity (Body Mass Index>30). Obesity is associated with an increase risk of cardiovascular complications.~Lipoprotein(a) is regarded as an independent risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease. Lp(a) is composed of low-density lipoprotein - like particle bound to glycoprotein molecule: apolipoprotein(a). Plasma levels are determinated to more than 90% by genetic factors (no significant influence of statin, weight, lifestyle factor: diet, exercise). Two study with few patients have found that aspirin lowers serum Lp(a) levels. Elevated Lp(a) is a risk factor for recurrent coronary events in obese patient.~Atherosclerosis is associated with imbalance of coagulation. TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor) is the earliest inhibitor of the blood coagulation process, natural direct inhibitor of tissue factor. In-vitro, TFPI activity is inhibited by high Lp(a) .~The aim of this study is to research reverse association between Lp(a) and TFPI activity in obese patient with chest pain like stable angina suggesting atherosclerotic heart disease and effect of aspirin.",
