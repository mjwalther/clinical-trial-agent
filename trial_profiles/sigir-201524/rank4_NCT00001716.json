    "title": "Effects of Nitric Oxide and Nitroglycerin in Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia",
    "brief_summary": "Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disease affecting African-Americans. About 1 in every 1000 African-Americans has the disease and 1 in every 12 carry the genes that could be passed on to their children. People with sickle cell anemia have abnormal hemoglobin, the molecules responsible for carrying oxygen in the blood. The abnormal hemoglobin can cause damage to the red blood cells. The damaged red blood cell may then stick in the blood vessels and cause pain and injury to organs. Some of the complications caused by the sticking of blood cells are called acute pain crisis and acute chest syndrome (ACS).~Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas that has been proposed as a possible therapy for the ACS complication of sickle cell anemia. Studies have shown that NO may favorably affect sickle cell hemoglobin molecules, thereby improving blood flow through small vessels.~This study is designed to evaluate the effects of NO, when taken in combination with a drug called nitroglycerin on patients with sickle cell anemia and normal volunteers. The effects of these two drugs only last while the patient is receiving them. Researchers hope the information learned from this study will help to develop new therapies for sickle cell anemia.",
