    "title": "Molecular, Cytological Features and Genetic Susceptibility of COPD Attributable to Different Environmental Exposures",
    "brief_summary": "The objective of this study is to investigate molecular, cytological and genetic features of occupational chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in conditions of different occupational exposures. In order to achieve this goal serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and standard inflammation markers level, hemostasis, cytological analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage and associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1800470 transforming growing factor β1 (TGF β1) gene, rs1828591 hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) gene, rs4129267 interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R) gene, rs1051730 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (CHRNA3) gene with COPD in subjects exposed to silica dust and in those exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exhaust will be investigated. The relationship between genotype and phenotype characteristics, such as an inflammation activity, assessed by C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α) serum concentration, in different occupational COPD groups will be studied. The hypothesis is that the mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are different due to environmental risk factor that reflex in differs in disease attributes - molecular biomarkers, cytology results and genetic susceptibility between COPD due to dust, COPD due to chemicals and COPD in smokers therefore COPD can be subdivided into ecological phenotypes according to environmental risk factor.",
