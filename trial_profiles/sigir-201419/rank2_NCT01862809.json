    "title": "Cigarette Smoking and Oral Microbiota",
    "brief_summary": "Background:~- Normal bacteria and other tiny organisms (the microbiota) live in the mouth and nose. They contribute to human health in many ways, including digesting food and balancing hormones. Testing samples from the mouth can show how microbiotas are related to health and disease. However, the microbiota in a person's mouth differs depending on the methods of collection and the part of the mouth that is tested. Understanding what can change the microbiota (including mouth sites, and what a person eats or smokes) will give more information on how to study oral microbiota and smoking-related cancers and other diseases.~Objectives:~To see how smoking affects the microbiotas in mouth and nose.~To determine which collection method for mouth specimens should be used for studying microbiota.~Eligibility:~Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been using tobacco products regularly for at least 5 years.~Individuals at least 18 years of age who have never smoked.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.~Participants will have a dental exam. They will provide a saliva sample. The dentist will take swabs from the inside of the mouth, including the tongue, tonsils, gums, and teeth. The inside of the nose will also be swabbed.~Participants will also fill out a questionnaire. It will ask about their history of smoking and consumption of alcohol, tea, and coffee. It will also ask about current medications, including antibiotics.",
